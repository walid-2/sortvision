## 🚀 Project Description
**Mada SortVision** is an interactive, educational web application designed to demystify the mechanics of common sorting algorithms. It provides a real-time, step-by-step visualization of how different algorithms process and arrange data.


---

## ✨ Features
* **Multiple Algorithms:** Choose from major sorting methods, including **Bubble Sort**, **Selection Sort**, **Insertion Sort**, **Merge Sort**, and **Quick Sort**.
* **Data Distributions:** Test algorithm performance on various initial conditions:
    * **Random**
    * **Reverse Sorted**
    * **Few Unique** (clustered data)
* **Dynamic Controls:** Adjust the **array size** (5 to 150 elements) and **visualization speed** on the fly.
* **Performance Metrics:** Track the learning curve with real-time displays for the number of **operations (Ops)** and the **elapsed time**.
